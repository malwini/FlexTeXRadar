## Stage of Adoption

The rings of a tech radar typically represent the stage of adoption of a technology. Based on the context provided,
here are the rings of your tech radar:

### Adopt

Technologies in the "Adopt" ring are those that the organization has decided to adopt and use in production. These are
proven, mature technologies that have been found to provide significant benefits.

### Trial

Technologies in the "Trial" ring are those that the organization is actively trying out. These technologies are
promising and have potential, but they are not yet fully adopted or proven within the organization.

### Assess

Technologies in the "Assess" ring are those that the organization is considering for future use. These
technologies are on the radar because they appear to have potential, but more investigation and testing are needed.

### Hold

Technologies in the "Hold" ring are those that the organization has decided not to use at the current time.
This could be because the technology is not yet mature enough, or because it does not align with the organization's
current needs or strategy.
