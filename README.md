# FlexTeXRadar

## How to use?

### Manual approach
You can create the thoughtworks radar by using the [ThoughtWorks Radar generator](https://radar.thoughtworks.com/).

**Steps**:

1. Get the url of the **raw** page of the config json file of the radar and copy the **permanent link**. e.g. `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FlexPwr/FlexTeXRadar/main/content/FlexPwrTechRadar%20-%202024.1.json`
2. Call the ThoughtWorks Radar generator with the copied url as documentID. e.g. `https://radar.thoughtworks.com/?documentId=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FlexPwr/FlexTeXRadar/main/content/FlexPwrTechRadar%20-%202024.1.json`


## Notes

- Not sure about the quadrant where to put a technology? Check the [quadrant definitions](https://www.thoughtworks.
  com/radar/faq#quadrant-definitions) of the ThoughtWorks Radar. But don't worry too much about it. The rings are 
  much more important than the quadrants.
- The radar is a snapshot of the current state. It is not a prediction of the future. It is a reflection of the 
  current thinking of the FlexPwr team.
